About me
======
PhD Mechanical and Metallurgical Engineering student at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica, Santiago. 
Previous research has focused on the design and modelling of packed-bed thermal energy storage systems using industrial waste materials for high temperature applications, such as CSP plants, and industrial process waste heat. Current research is focused on te identification of an effective operation and control strategy to integrate packed-bed storage systems to different thermal processes.
