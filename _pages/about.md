PhD Mechanical and Metallurgical Engineering student at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica. 
Previous research has focused on the design and modelling of packed-bed thermal energy storage systems using industrial waste materials for high temperature applications, such as CSP plants, and industrial process waste heat. Current research is focused on the identification of an effective operation and control strategy to integrate packed-bed storage systems to different thermal processes.

I teach the course ME5603 "Energy Storage" at Universidad de Chile, and undergraduate course where different energy storage technologies are reviewed, with focus on their main characteristics, modelling, and integration to energy generation processes.

Personal keywords:
* Thermal Energy Storage.
* Packed-bed systems.
* Transport phenomena on porous media.
* Numerical methods.
* Design and modelling of thermal systems.
