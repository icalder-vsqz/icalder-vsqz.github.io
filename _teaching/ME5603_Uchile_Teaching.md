*Course description*: 

Energy storage systems allow extending for a longer time the delivery of energy by energy systems, from a solar heater for hot water to a photovoltaic plant to produce electricity. The purpose of the Energy Storage course is for the student to learn about current energy storage technologies within systems based on renewable sources. Within this context, the student will apply thermodynamic and energy conservation theory to study the performance of the different existing storage technologies and their integration into energy generation/conversion systems. The student should be able to recognize the effects and benefits of using energy storage and value its importance in sustainability, climate change, and the decarbonization plan of the energy sector.
